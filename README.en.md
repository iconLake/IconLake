iconLake - You Create, You Own!

## Goal

Build a full life cycle management tool for creation in the web3.0 era.

## Original Aspiration and Mission

The original aspiration of iconLake is to serve creators. We hope that every work of every creator can be respected and protected, and that their works can be exhibited with the unique temperament of each creator.

## The value of iconLake to "me"

### "I" am a creator

1. iconLake can help me archive all my creations in categories;
2. iconLake can protect the copyright of my original works and ensure that my works can make me money;
3. iconLake can provide me with a personalized exhibition of my works;

### "I" am an user

## iconLake needs you

iconLake is a decentralized project, and we are also committed to building this project in a decentralized way, so iconLake needs you.

I believe that everyone has more or less felt the employment pressure in the Internet industry. Both large and small companies have sent a large number of talents to the society.
So many free and idle talents (whether active or passive) will inevitably spawn a large number of new projects. These new projects are the vital force for the next big explosion, and iconLake is one of them.

If you don’t want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, take off your shoes and go into the river. Don’t wait and see on the shore. If you want to catch big fish, do it now.

Your contribution to iconLake will be confirmed through the blockchain. What you get is not only numbers, but also assets.

Let us participate in the "infinite game" of iconLake and inject infinite possibilities into iconLake!

Whether you are a development engineer, designer, product manager, operator, operation and maintenance, tester, user... iconLake needs you.

## Q&A

### How does iconLake protect original works?

Based on blockchain technology, iconLake stores each work on the chain in a decentralized manner. The information cannot be tampered with, the work is verifiable, and the creator has ownership of his or her work.

### What is LAKE?

LAKE is confirmed through blockchain technology, which is used to record the certificates obtained by participants who have contributed to the development of iconLake and can be used to share profits.

### What is DROP?

DROP is the fee that needs to be paid to save information on the chain, but this fee does not cost money. Instead, after your account opens the accumulation of DROP, it accumulates 1udrop (1DROP=10000udrop) every second. If it exceeds 60 DROP, it will stop. To accumulate, you need to confirm the accumulated DROP on the chain, and then start the next round of accumulation again, so that you will have a steady stream of DROP to pay for the cost of on-chain.
